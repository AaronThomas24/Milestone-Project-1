For my milestone project I will be doing a mock of the game Doodle Jump. Doodle jump has been a popular game for years now, and a game that I have been playing ever since I got my first iphone. Doodle Jump was a great past time of mine, and I am interested in making my own version of it. To play you will use your arrow keys to move character left and right. The goal is to land on a platform using the arrow keys without falling. Once you miss a platform and fall the game will be over and your score will appear on the screen.
